          <p></p><br>
          <p> Being a part of Berkeley’s highly politically engaged campus, my team and I
            noticed people all around us looking for ways to take action and support political
            causes that they believe in. This generation has strong political opinions,
            and its members are not afraid to vote, protest and boycott to make their opinions heard.
            However, the reality is that daily activism is <strong>difficult</strong> and <strong>requires a continuous,
            sustained effort</strong> that the many people just aren't able to commit.<br><br>
            <p class="quote">DollarVote wants to combat this friction and allow people to <strong>seamlessly integrate political impact into
            their everyday routine.</strong></p>
            <br><br><p>
            We do this through our Chrome extension, which integrates itself naturally into online
            shopping experiences and informs people about how different brands impact political causes
            they care about, allowing them to put their dollar towards causes
            they believe in while staying informed about the impact of their purchases.</p>

              <div class="underline-dv"></div><br>
              <p>Dollar Vote shows the user relevant data about the political
                impact of companies as they're shopping online. We filter companies
                 based on the user's personal value profile.<br><br>
                 Currently, boycotting a company requires users to: <br><br>1. perform research
                 about companies related to causes they care about and keep track of that list.<br>2. dig into
                 the weighty public donation databases, which are dense and difficult to parse.<br><br>
                 This means changing your entire shopping habit, and investing time and effort
                 into researching companies before every purchase.

          <p><br>To better understand how willing people would be to make changes to their shopping habits,
            I conducted a survey among UC Berkeley students to understand how much they cared about various issues,
            and also how much they would be willing to alter their shopping habits to support those issues.<br><br>
            For the causes that people cared deeply about, as expected, they were more willing to actively
            avoid purchasing from that company. <br>In another survey conducted by Cone Communication CSR, it was found that:<br><br>
            <p class="quote"><strong>76%</strong> of Americans said that
            they wouldn't buy a product from a company that they knew didn't support their beliefs.<br><br>
            <strong>87%</strong> of Americans said they would purchase an item if they found out that a company supports a cause
             that aligns with their views. </p>
             <br><br><p>
              The amount that people said they cared about a certain issue directly correlated with their
              willingness to boycott it. This shaped the way that we decided to rate the companies,
              ensuring that the product scores that we show to the user align with their true values.
              This greatly influenced our onboarding flow, which was initial a "checkbox" system where users
              could simple click yes/no on a value - now, we ask user to weight the issues on a 1-10 scale,
              so we capture more of the nuances behind a user's political beliefs.

                Being able to <strong>accurately gauge the political views and opinions of users</strong> is a
                 key part of Dollar Vote. Ivana Ng, product designer at public benefit corporation <a href="https://www.navapbc.com/" class="magical--underline"> NavaPBC</a>,
                 and a mentor for our team, gave her feedback from years
                 of crafting onboarding experiences for governmental services that required a lot of
                 information from the user: narrowing the scope, whenever possible, and keeping
                 users from having to fill out any information that they don't feel is immediately relevant to them
                 will help eliminate frustration and decrease drop-off during the process.
                 <br><br>
                After brainstorming and testing different ideas for gathering sufficient information
                without overwhelming the user, we implemented a 2-step onboarding process which allows
                users to first select which topics they're interested in delving deeper into, and then answer the
                tagged value-based questions to complete their profile.

            <p>
              The information that we present on the popup is to empower users with information, and
                the ultimate goal is to influence the user's decisions by providing
              data that is on-the-spot and relevant, while not being invasive and disruptive to their
               shopping experience. <br><br> While designing our application, my team and I were extremely cognizant
               about the importance of transparency and ethical conduct with both the data that we receive from
               users, and the data that we're showing in the hopes of influencing shopping decisions.
               On the "learn more" links, users will be able to read more about our data sources, select information
               relevant to the company they're exploring, and decide for themselve whether to purchase from them.

          <p>My team and I had the opportunity to be part of <a href=

            Code it Forward's
            inaugural BUILD cohort</a>. Working with experts in the civic digital technology space
            and learning how to design ethical technologies for social good from the ground up
            was an invaluable learning experience.</p>
            <p>We're currently working with our mentors to prepare Dollar Vote for launch! If you're
              interested in learning more about our product, or have any feedback for the idea, shoot
