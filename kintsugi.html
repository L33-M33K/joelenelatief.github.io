            <p> Kintsugi is a smart voice journaling application that uses AI to measure and
              predict well-being. Our research-backed plans, based off of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
            help users reduce stress and build self-care habits into their daily routine. </p>

                <strong>Objective:</strong> Increase new user retention rates.</p>
              </strong>
              <p>
                <br> At the start, our data showed that a large number of new users (40%)
                would make a just one or two journal entries before dropping off. My goal was to first
                 <strong>understand why</strong> these users stopped using Kintsugi, <strong>pinpoint user needs</strong>,
                  and <strong>design & implement a workflow</strong> to
                 set users up for success on their self-care journeys with Kintsugi.<br><br>
                 Kintsugi is <strong>$20</strong> on the app store, so users that have made the
                 investment <i>are</i> interested in the benefits that Kintsugi has to offer. So what was stopping people from
                 building the self-care habits that they set out to when they downloaded Kintsugi, or what expectations were Kintsugi not meeting?
                 Just like getting into a new exercise routine, results aren't immediately obvious;
                 it takes consistency to see growth. How can we set users up to expect and experience growth in the long term?

            <p>
              <br>
              To better understand how we could shape user's self-care habits, I first set out to
              understand their current habits and what resources
              they used to achieve them.
            </p>
            <p>

              Here are some of the main ones mentioned: <br>
            </p>

          </p>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-4">
              <p class="quote"> Pen & paper journals </p>
              <div class="underline"></div><br>
              <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> people used their journals as the place for
              everything from daily thoughts, to goals and future plans, to daily to-do lists.</p>
              <p><strong>Pros:</strong> easily accessible and no learning curve</p>
              <p><strong>Cons:</strong> lack of organization (things get lost), difficult to
              make actionable improvements because "progress" isn't
              easily defined, often neglected when life gets busy. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
              <p class="quote"> Organization apps & planners</p>
              <div class="underline"></div><br>
              <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> goal-setting, scheduling, short and long term planning.</p>
              <p><strong>Pros:</strong> clear functionality and purpose.</p>
              <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Difficult to see how daily progress ties into larger goals. Users often associated "goals"
            with more tangible or professional achievements. Just like physical-health goals (eg, "run a 10k", "lose 5lbs"),
          mental health needs a way to be tracked in order for effective goals to be set and achieved.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
              <p class="quote"> Therapy sessions</p>
              <div class="underline"></div><br>
              <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> safe space to express emotions and receive advice, accountability for goals. </p>
              <p><strong>Pros:</strong> professional advice and support</p>
              <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Not always accessible - therapists, especially, are often prohibitively expensive
                and scarce in many areas. Therapy has stigmas surrounding it, and people aren't always willing
                to seek it. Therapy is not a substitute for daily self-care practices.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p><br><br>For people that successfully utilized these resources, it took time for people
           to learn what is most effective for them and what gives them the most value.
          Similarly, growing Kintsugi into a natural part of the user's self-care routine also depends
          on the user discovering what works for them. Further, Kintsugi has an added
          layer of being an all in one journal that <strong>responds</strong>, then offers the tools
          to turn those insights into action.</p>

            <div class="col-md-4">
              <p>Reaping the benefits of journaling requires <strong>habit</strong> and <strong>consistency</strong>.
                Data gathered through <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3505409/" class="magical--underline">NIH research</a>, and user interviews I conducted with
                Kintsugi's engaged users, showed that
                it takes about 4 days of consistent journaling for a habit to begin to form.
              <br><br> This knowledge helped further define the problem we were solving:
              guiding new users to the point where they discover their first insight,
              develop an understanding of how Kintsugi can work for them personally, and begin forming a habit.

                complicated emotions, but it took several sessions for me to really get used to talking to the app." <br><br> "I feel like the app

              <p> The barrier to consistent voice journaling was not solely due to the novelty of the voice
                journaling aspect of Kintsugi, as we initially hypothesized. People
                that have maintained paper journals were much more <strong>willing to openly express
                their thoughts and emotions.</strong></p>
              <p> <strong>Action:</strong> provide users with more structured prompts and guidance for
                their first journal entries, to build confidence in expressing themselves. </p>

                  them with suggestions, suggesting that we
                needed to work on <strong>building trust</strong> and <strong>establishing a personal relationship
                </strong> with the user. Looking at data, I created a rough "relationship roadmap" to help

              Duolingo, an app that helps users learn a new language by making language
            learning a habit, builds consistency through daily reminders and learning plans -
          users expect us to offer a similar structure in Kintsugi's workflow.<br><br>
          We needed to establish a relationship with the users. In order to do that, like Duo the friendly owl,
          Kintsugi needed a personality its own. One that inspires trust and support in the user.
          <br><br> Kintsugi is, like a friend or therapist you would open up to, supportive, caring, knowledgeable - our messaging and visuals needed to support that.

        </p>
              <p><strong>Action:</strong> introduce structure and accountability into the workflow, so
              users build journaling habits, and encourage users along the way.</p>

            <p> To understand how we could adapt the research-backed therapy practices for Kintsugi,
              I worked closely with Mario Lopes, an MD therapist, who explained to me
              that therapy is, at its core, about getting to know yourself better. The role of the therapist
              is to facilitate that process. Just like
              any relationship, Kintsugi should approach getting to know the user in
              levels. We brainstormed ideas for a "questionnaire" additional feature
              that would help give us more data so we could give further personalized recommendations.
            </p>
              <p><strong>Feature Feedback:</strong><br> The questions, which
                are largely based on building a therapy-patient relationship, were
                too heavy-weight for new users - we needed to <strong>show value</strong> before asking
                for this info. <br><br>From this first idea, we began brainstorming ways to get to know the user,
                but in a less clinical and direct way that tied in our key feature of voice journaling.</p>

      <h1>PHASE 2: DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION</h1>
      <div class="row impact">
        <div class="col-md-10"><br><br>
          <p>From the user research, we distilled the key elements for the new user workflow, which included
            establishing a relationship with the user, introducing mechanisms to help users build consistent habits,
            and provide more guidance to users getting to know the application. <br><br> Before I designed this workflow,
            Kintsugi took users straight from filling out their basic information to the main recording screen,
            with no further guidance than this welcome message, which contained all the relevant information
            for the users to understand how to effectively get started - however, offering all the info up front
            didn't offer users the opportunity to explore as they listened. Additionally, offering
             all the instructions right up front resulted in a lengthy message - not ideal for a new
             user looking to jump right in and try the product out.<br><br> The new workflow
           allows the user to "test-drive" the voice-journaling feature right away, and
           then receive further guidance as they go. The welcome message is still available for
           users to listen to whenever they want to, but is no longer their sole source of instruction.</p>

          </p>
          <p><strong>User feedback</strong></p>
          <p>Users needed to be shown more incremental value as we asked for information.
            Adding an extra step to the onboarding survey asking them for information about their
            focus areas before we have shown them any tangible value was prohibitive to people
            completing the onboarding process, and more people dropping off even <i>before</i>
            they had made their first recording. Additionally, this flow didn't meet the criteria
            of helping users build their habits incrementally. For the next interation of the workflow,
            I focused more heavily on getting users recording frequently, spreading out the
            feature education for users to discover as they explore, and keeping the process lightweight,
            ensuring that we provide value every step of the way.

          offers the user relevant information about each feature while they're exploring,
          and tell the user that we'll give them better, more accurate results the more they journal.</p>

             to users from all over the world sharing inspiration and feedback,
